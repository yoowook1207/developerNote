# What is Angular?
- Angular is a Typescript-based open-source frontend framework. Angular can be used to build either web or mobile app.
- Angular presents all the front-end solutions on it. (e.g. router, HTTP Client..)

</br>

# What is TypeScript?
- TypeScript is an Object-oriented programming language based on JavaScript, and added optional types, classes, interfaces and more.
- Browser compiles TS to JS.
- The type system of TypeScript is optional. The language does not force developer to use static typing.

  > **Benefits of TS**: Static typing of TypeScript will help the compiler and show any potential error warnings before an app is even run. Static typing also let the developer know what type of data the APIs expect.

# Key components of Angular
- Component: basic building blocks of angular applications to control HTML views
- Modules: a set of angular basic building blocks. Logical boundaries in the application (may includes components, directives, services, etc.)
- Templates: represents the views of Angular application
- Services: single, shared instance for any component registered in the service (e.g. _providedIn: "root"_)
 
</br>

# Directives
- Components: directives with a template
- Structural directives: change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements (e.g. _*ngIf, *ngFor_)
- Attribute directives: change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive (e.g. _ngClass, ngStyle, ngModel_)
 
</br>

# Data binding in Angular
- Component to DOM
  - Interpolation
    > ``` {{ value }} ```
  - Property binding
    > ``` [property]="value" ```
- DOM to Component
  - Event binding
    > ``` (event)="function" ```
  - Two-way binding
    > ``` [(ngModel)]="value" ```
 
</br>

# Angular lifecycle hooks

1. **ngOnChanges**: When the value of the data-bound property changes, this method is called.
2. **ngOnInit**: whenever the initialization of the directive/component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties happens.
3. **ngDoCheck**: called for the detection and to act on changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own.
4. **ngAfterContentInit**: called in response after Angular projects external content into the component's view.
5. **ngAfterContentChecked**: called in response after Angular checks the content projected into the component.
6. **ngAfterViewInit**: called in response after Angular initializes the component's views and child views.
7. **ngAfterViewChecked**: called in response after Angular checks the component's views and child views.
8. **ngOnDestroy**: the cleanup phase just before Angular destroys the directive/component.

> **_constructor vs. ngOnInit_**
> - **constructor** is called first, usually import services in it. _Dependency Injection._ Constructor cannot get the data from @Input
> - **ngOnInit** is Angular's own method. used to initial define Angular bindings. It is the best place to prepare initial data for its component. It happens after OnChanges, so it can get the data from @Input.

>  **_bootstrap_** in _app.module_
> - The module tells the app which component to bootstrap, as in start the application
 
</br>

# Communication with components and data
- **@Input**, get data from Parent;
- **@Output**, emit data to Parent;
- **@ViewChild**, get element from only one sub dom;
- **@ViewChildren**, get elements from sub-dom, as a node list;
- **Service**, share data through components;
- **NgRx**, a library for state management, share data via a singleton data store in-app.

</br>

# Service
- A service is used when various modules need to use a common functionality. Services allow for greater separation of concerns for the application and better modularity.

### HTTP Client
- A methods to communicate with backend services from a frontend application over HTTP protocol. (using either _XMLHttpRequest_ interface or _fetch()_ API)
- provide HttpInterceptor to set headers of requests

### CLI
```
ng g s path/serviceName
```

</br>

# Pipe
- A pipe takes data as input and transforms it into the desired output. We use pipes in the template to manipulate data step by step or get the data from observables.
### CLI
  ```
  ng g p pipeName
  ```
### Async pipe
- The Async pipe subscribes an observable or promise, and gets the latest value that the observable has emitted.
- When a new value is emitted, the pipe marks the component to be checked for changes.
### Parameterized pipe
  - declaring the pipe name with a colon and showing the format of output value.
  ```
  {{ birthday | date: 'dd/MM/yyyy' }}
  ```
### Pipe chains
  ```
  {{ data | date | uppercase }}
  ```

> **_Pure vs. Impure pipe_**
>  - A pure pipe is only called when Angular detects a change in the value or the parameters passed to a pipe. 
>  - An impure pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter whether the value or parameters change. every keystroke or mouse move will call the impure pipe.

</br>

# Observable
- Observables are used to provide support for passing messages between publishers and subscribers in your application. Use for event handling, async programming, and handling multiple values.

> **_How to handle HttpClient Error?_**
> - HttpClient will return an error in the object. Catch the error in the _second_ callback function of the subscribe function.

> **_Observable vs. Promise_**
> | Promise | Observable |
> | ----------- | ----------- |
> | creates one value | provides multiple values over time |
> | immediately called, cannot stop | needs to subscribe, unsubscribe to stop |
> | push errors to its child promises | handle the error in subscribe method |
> | .then( ) .catch( ) .finally( ) to manipulate data step bt step | RxJs operators, using pipe( ) to manipulate data |
> | | |
