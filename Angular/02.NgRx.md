# What is NgRx?
- A *state management library* for Angular, the idea comes from redux.
  - Redux is a reactive state management library mad by Facebook.
  - NgRx is a redux implementation using RxJS. 

## Advantages of NgRx (SHARI principle)
- **S**hared: state that is accessed by many components and services.
- **H**ydrated: state that is persisted and rehydrated from external storage.
- **A**vailable: state that needs to be available when re-entering routes.
- **R**etrieved: state that must be retrieved with a side-effect.
- **I**mpacted: state that is impacted by actions from other sources.

## NgRx state management lifecycle

- **STORE** : Behavior subject. The storage of the application. It is immutable and only altered by actions. **select( )** to return a data from Store. **dispatch( )** to allow components to send actions to the Store
- **SELECTOR** : Behavior subject name. Pure functions used to select, derive and compose pieces of state.
- **ACTION** : Function's name. Describes unique events that are dispatched from components and services.
- **EFFECTS** : Http request. Handle tasks such as fetching data, long-running tasks that produce multiple events, and other external interactions where components don't need explicit knowledge of these interactions.
- **REDUCERS** : Responsible for handling transitions from one state to the next state in the application. Group of pure functions. Take in the current state of the application action, and return a new state object
