# Ionic

- Ionic is an open source UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile apps using web technologies.
- Ionic focuses on the frontend UX and UI interaction of an app
- Ionic is the only mobile app stack that enables web developers to build apps for all major app stores and the mobile web from a single codebase.

## @ionic/angular
- Angular has always been at the center of what makes Ionic great. While the core components have been written to work as a standalone Web Component library, the @ionic/angular package makes integration with the Angular ecosystem a breeze. @ionic/angular includes all the functionality that Angular developers would expect coming from Ionic 2/3, and integrates with core Angular libraries, like the Angular router.
- Ionic supports Angular 6.0.0 and up.
- All module in Ionic is lazyLoading as default. (Ionic Angular 4.0 and up)
