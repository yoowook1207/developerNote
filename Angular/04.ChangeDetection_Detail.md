# Angular Change Detection

## What is Change Detection?
- Angular should reflect the application state in the DOM. When the application state is changed, Angular has to update View. Change Detection is a mechanism that detects the application state changes, then synchronize View(DOM) and Model
- Angular = Change Detection / React = Virtual DOM

</br>

## How does Change Detection work?
1. A developer updates Model
2. Angular detects a situation in which a change may occur through the **ngZone** and causes change detection.
3. Change Detection inspects all the components from the top parent to the lowest child (top-down inspection)
4. If the change is detected, update View of the component

</br>

## ngZone?
- A mechanism that helps to work on connected asynchronous tasks, and keeps track and intercept any asynchronous tasks.
- ngZone detects where _changes_ may occur, then run Change Detection automatically.
- So, in default, developer does not have to worry about when should run Change Detection.
> Angular patches several low-level browser APIs at startup to be able to detect changes in the application. This is done using zone.js which patches APIs such as _EventEmitter_, _DOM event listeners_, _XMLHttpRequest_, _fs_ API in Node.js and more.
> In short, the framework will trigger a change detection if one of the following events occurs:
> - any browser event (click, keyup, etc.)
> - setInterval() and setTimeout()
> - HTTP requests via XMLHttpRequest

- There exists only one NgZone and change detection is only triggered for async operations triggered in this zone.

## Change Detection Strategies
- Two Change Detection strategies in Angular: Default / OnPush
- Default strategy detects entire components from top to bottom (Dirty checking). It may negatively influence the app performance.
- OnPush Change Detection Strategy
  - Use OnPush strategy as adding changeDetection property in component decorator metadata
    ```typescript
        @Component({
        selector: 'hero-card',
        changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
        template: ...
        })
        export class HeroCard {
            ...
        }
    ```
  - OnPush strategy provides the possibility to skip unnecessary checks for this component and all it's child components.

    <details><summary>Using OnPush strategy, the component only need to be updated if:</summary>
    <p>
    - the input reference has changed </br>
    - the component or one of its children triggers an event handler </br>
    - change detection is triggered manually </br>
    - an observable linked to the template via the async pipe emits a new value </br>
    </p>
    </details>

## OnPush Change Detection
> | Situation | When | Note |
> | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
> |@Input()|only triggered if a **new reference** is passed as `@Input()` value.| pass _new object_ or _array_  references
> |Event Handler|triggered if the `OnPush` Component or one of its child components triggers an event handler (ex. clicking on a button)|`OnPush` is **not** triggered by</br> - `setTimeout`</br> -  `setInterval`</br> -  `Promise.resolve().then()`</br> -  `this.http.get('...').subscribe()` (in general, any RxJS observable subscription)
> |Manually| - `detectChanges()` on `ChangeDetectorRef` </br> - `ApplicationRef.tick()` </br> - `markForCheck()` it **does not** trigger changeDetection, but marks all `OnPush` ancestors as to be checked once, either as part of the current or next change detection cycle. It will run change detection on marked components even though they are using the `OnPush` strategy.|
> |Async Pipe|<details><summary>Async Pipe</summary><p>The built-in `AsyncPipe` subscribes to an observable and returns the latest value it has emitted. Internally the `AsyncPipe` calls `markForCheck` each time a new value is emitted [AsyncPipe code reference](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/5.2.10/packages/common/src/pipes/async_pipe.ts#L139)</p></details> the `AsyncPipe` automatically works using `OnPush` change detection strategy||
