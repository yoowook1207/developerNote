# Angular Interview Questions

## Observable vs. Promise
> | | Promise | Observable |
> | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
> | Value | creates *one* value | provides *multiple values* over time |
> | Stream | *immediately* called, cannot stop | needs to *subscribe*, unsubscribe to stop |
> | Error Handle | push errors to its *child promises* | handle the error in *subscribe method* |
> | Data Handle | .then( ) .catch( ) .finally( ) to manipulate data step bt step | RxJs operators, using *pipe( )* to manipulate data |

## Observable vs. Subject
- Observable is for the consumer, it can be transformed and subscribed.
- Subject implements both the Observable and the Observer interface.
- Observables are unicast and Subjects are multicast.

Observable
```javascript
import {Observable} from 'rxjs';

let obs = Observable.create(observer=>{
   observer.next(Math.random());
})

obs.subscribe(res=>{
  console.log('subscription a :', res); //subscription a :0.2859800202682865
});

obs.subscribe(res=>{
  console.log('subscription b :', res); //subscription b :0.694302021731573
});
```
Subject
```javascript
import {Subject} from 'rxjs';

let obs = new Subject();

obs.subscribe(res=>{
  console.log('subscription a :', res); // subscription a : 0.91767565496093
});

obs.subscribe(res=>{
  console.log('subscription b :', res);// subscription b : 0.91767565496093
});

obs.next(Math.random());
```

## Lifecycle in Angular component
1. **ngOnChanges** : (if the component has bound inputs), and on data-bound input changes
2. **ngOnInit** : after component is created
3. **ngDoCheck** : Called immediately after ngOnChanges() on every change detection run, and immediately after ngOnInit() on the first run.
4. ngAfterContentInit
5. ngAfterContentChecked
6. ngAfterViewInit
7. ngAfterViewChecked
8. **ngOnDestroy** : Cleanup just before Angular destroys the directive or component. Unsubscribe Observables and detach event handlers to avoid **_memory leaks_**.

</br>

## Constructor vs. ngOnInit
- Constructor’s a default method of a class executed when such class is instantiated. NgOnInit is a lifecycle hook that happens after a component is finished being created.
- The Constructor is used to handle dependency injection and not much else, while NgOnInit is where actual work should be done when all components’ bindings are resolved.

## changeDetection OnPush
- With default change detection we check all expressions of all templates on the hierarchy tree, while with onpush angular will only update our component upon an input reference changing, event from the component or its children, an async pipe linked to the template emits a different value, or a manual trigger.
